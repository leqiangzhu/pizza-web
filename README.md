## Description
Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes
